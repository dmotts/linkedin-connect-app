## Installation

- [Download the repo](https://github.com/zdhenard42/Linked_Connect_Bot/archive/refs/tags/V1.0.zip) and extract the folder to somewhere on your desktop 
- Run main.py

## Usage example

Using this program, you can quickly grow your connections 1000+ in 1-2 weeks.  
I recommend not sending more than 100 connections a day to avoid a temporary cooldown by LinkedIn
